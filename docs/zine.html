This page might eventually be combined with the <a href="downloads.html">Downloads</a> page, or maybe swapped with it, since I don't want to dump people onto a potentially giant page without forewarning (Maybe I'll move the 'Zine' link to the footer; a user might reasonably want to have a one-click link to that reading-optimized page, but I'd rather not surprise anyone with it).</section>
