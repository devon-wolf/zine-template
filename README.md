# zine-template
A template site designed with a zine-type format in mind. Originally intended as a home for a year-end showcase for a group of writers and artists. Feel free to fork and use for projects that might make good use of the format!

Currently very in-progress, see [to-do list](./to-do.md) for details.

Routes, models, and general Express setup was done by working through [this](https://www.robinwieruch.de/node-express-server-rest-api) tutorial (and the Node.js with Babel and Express.js setup before it, all from [Robin Wieruch](https://www.robinwieruch.de/about)).
