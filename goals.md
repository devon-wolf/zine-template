# Showcase Goals
- create a site to display submissions from group members

That, truly, is the only hard and fast goal. Other things I'd *like* to do include allowing readers to leave comments/feedback on the submitted works, but all this really needs to do is be a place to read/view collected submissions.

With that in mind, what features does the site need to have?
- A table of contents/index:
	- there should be an organized list of the showcase content with relevant links; each submitter should have their own landing page that links to all the works they contributed to the showcase; there are many ways this could be organized, but the most obvious is a central landing page with all authors/artists listed; there should also be a master list to links of all submissions that is not siloed by author

- As mentioned above, a landing page for each contributor
- A dedicated page for each individual submission
	- I'll need to make some database-related choices in order to store submissions and their metadata in an orderly, efficient way
- ~~A homepage for orientation~~ (I mean, the page exists; not like there's anything useful there, but it exists...)
- ~~A navigation bar present on all pages~~
