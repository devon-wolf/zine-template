# TOOB Showcase Goals
- create a site to display submissions from TOOB members

That, truly, is the only hard and fast goal. Other things I'd *like* to do include allowing readers to leave comments/feedback on the submitted works, but all this really needs to do is be a place to read our collected submissions.

With that in mind, what features does the site need to have?
- A table of contents/index:
	- there should be an organized list of the showcase content with relevant links; each submitter should have their own landing page that links to all the works they contributed to the showcase; there are many ways this could be organized, but the most obvious is a central landing page with all authors/artists listed; there should also be a master list to links of all submissions that is not siloed by author

- As mentioned above, a landing page for each contributor
- A dedicated page for each individual submission
	- it seems messy and inefficient to directly write each submission into its respective HTML file; I'll probably write a template file and feed the contributions from their own files
- A homepage for orientation
- A navigation bar present on all pages
