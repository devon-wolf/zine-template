# To do:
- ~~add a "Downloads" link to the footer; will link to a page that links to zine files (without having to load the whole zine page)~~
- FIGURE OUT HOW TO DO PARTIALS/TEMPLATES - I'm disinclined to update anything else in the header or footer or general page structure until I can do this without needing to update every HTML file by hand. There has to be an easy answer here.
- ~~create the linked pages in the footer:~~
	- ~~Copyright~~
	- ~~Source Code~~
	- ~~Downloads~~
- add some sort of data structure to hold work and contributor info
- ~~build the views for individual contributors and works~~
- **DON'T FORGET**: the HTML files need to be grouped into folders and renamed as-needed, meaning the links in the navbar will need to be updated across all the pages once this is done.
- create optimized/navigable/pleasing to read layout for "read as zine" page
- **REACH**: add a commenting feature
- **REACH**: add an in-site form for adding new works and contributors
- **REACH**: add authentication for unique users and the ability to edit one's own works/contributor page/comments
